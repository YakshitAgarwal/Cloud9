Hello everyone! This is my react project “Cloud9”, which shows the weather information for specified location. 
It includes the temperature, wind speed, humidity and description of the location. 
I used https://openweathermap.org/ for fetching weather data. 
This project has two main components: Weather and Search. 
Weather component is having an index file where I fetch the weather data. 
Search component also has an index file where the location of the place can be fetched. 
I have added Mumbai’s weather data which shows up after every refreshing of page using useEffect. 
The data will also be present in console.
